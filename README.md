# Mr-Potter
//Simple board game where a user controlled unit moves around a map, looking to get to a target spot before an AI controlled unit.

You enter the realm of magic and The Game of the Stone. This year the contestants are Malfucious (M) and Periander Popotter (L). They are both trying to find THE STONE (S).
Unfortunately, the headmaster Peter Mantalorian has strong feelings against Periander and decides to bewitch Malfucious, control him and reach the stone before Periander,
as well as creating an identical copy of THE STONE that spawns at a different place with each run, as do the two contestants.

The aim of the user (M) is to navigate through each maze and reach the stone (S) before the opponent (L).
M can be moved around using the WASD buttons, while pressing any other key will result in the player not moving at all.
The map can be switched from within the code.
